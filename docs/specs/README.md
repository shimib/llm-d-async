# Formal specifications (TLA+)

Machine-checked models of subtle concurrency in the Async Processor. These are
*specifications*, not tests of the Go code — they model the intended algorithm so
we can prove safety/liveness properties hold for **every** interleaving, including
the rare ones load tests never hit (concurrent admits, pod crashes mid-flight).

| Spec | Models | Result |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| [`GateQuota.tla`](GateQuota.tla) | the `redis-quota` concurrency gate: acquire / dispatch / release across many workers, plus crash-induced leaks and TTL reclaim | **all properties hold** |
| [`GateQuotaRace.tla`](GateQuotaRace.tla) | the same gate with a **non-atomic** acquire (check-then-increment in two steps) | **NoOverAdmission violated** (TLC prints the trace) |
| [`MsgLifecycle.tla`](MsgLifecycle.tla) | the Pub/Sub message → dispatch → result → ack flow, where completion is correlated through a process-global map keyed by `msg.ID`, under at-least-once redelivery | **current design: `AckIntegrity` and `NoStuckCallback` both violated.** A corrected design (flip one constant) holds. |

## Why this gate

The `redis-quota` gate (`pkg/async/inference/flowcontrol`, mode `concurrency`)
caps in-flight requests per tenant attribute (e.g. `team`) using a shared Redis
counter. Two things make it worth modeling formally:

1. **Atomicity.** The limit check and the increment must be one atomic operation
   (a Lua script / atomic INCR-with-compare). If they are two operations, two
   workers can both observe `counter < Limit` and both increment — over-admission.
2. **Crash leaks.** A worker that acquires a slot and then crashes never runs its
   release. The counter stays over-counted until the Redis key's TTL expires. This
   was observed for real: killing pods mid-flight left quota counters stuck high
   until expiry.

`GateQuota.tla` captures both. The model has *K* workers sharing per-team
counters; each worker loops over `acquire → release`, may `crash` while holding a
slot (the slot becomes "orphaned"), and a `reaper` process models TTL expiry
reclaiming orphaned slots.

## Properties

Checked over 3 workers × 2 tiers (limits 2 and 1) — 325 distinct states:

- **`TypeOK`** — state stays well-formed.
- **`NoOverAdmission`** *(safety)* — `counter[t] ≤ Limit[t]` always. This is the
  whole point of the gate, and it holds **because acquire is one atomic step**.
- **`AccountingConsistent`** *(safety)* — `counter[t] = (live holders) + (orphaned)`.
  No phantom slots, no under-count. Crash moves a slot from "held" to "orphaned"
  without changing the counter; the counter only drops on release or reclaim.
- **`ConcurrencyBounded`** *(safety, derived)* — real in-flight per tier ≤ limit.
- **`NoPermanentLeak`** *(liveness)* — `<>[] (orphan = 0)`: leaked slots are
  *eventually* reclaimed (modeled with weak fairness on the reaper), so a crash
  cannot pin tenant capacity forever. **This is exactly the property a missing or
  too-long Redis TTL would break** — drop the reaper and TLC reports the leak.

## What the race model proves

`GateQuotaRace.tla` is identical except the acquire is split into `CHECK` (pass the
limit test) and `COMMIT` (increment) as two steps. TLC immediately finds a 5-state
counter-example with limit 1 and two workers:

```
both workers CHECK (counter=0 < 1)  -> both decide to admit
worker w1 COMMITs                   -> counter = 1
worker w2 COMMITs                   -> counter = 2   <-- exceeds Limit = 1
```

This is the concrete justification for implementing the gate with an atomic Redis
operation rather than a read-modify-write.

## What the message-lifecycle model found (a real gap)

`MsgLifecycle.tla` is the most complex model here, and unlike the first two it was
written to *probe* the current implementation rather than confirm a known fact — and
it surfaced a latent defect.

**The code** (`pkg/pubsub/pubsubimpl.go`). For each received message the per-message
callback:

1. stores its completion channel in a **process-global map keyed by the Pub/Sub
   message id** — `resultChannels.Store(msg.ID, ch)` (`:494`);
2. dispatches the request to a worker and then **blocks on a bare channel receive**,
   `result := <-resultsChannel` (`:554`), *not* guarded by `ctx`;
3. on return runs, unconditionally, `defer resultChannels.Delete(msg.ID)` (`:495`).

The result worker signals completion by doing `resultChannels.Load(id)` and sending
to **whatever channel is currently stored for that id** (`:350-356`) — not the
specific delivery whose work just finished.

**The catch.** Pub/Sub is *at-least-once*: the same `msg.ID` can be delivered again
while a prior delivery is still being processed. Two concrete triggers exist in this
code:

- a server-side ack-deadline expiry while a message is parked by a **pool-level
  `Wait` gate** or held during a long dispatch, and
- the **budget-change restart** at `:422-444`, where `cancel()` tears down `Receive`
  while a callback is still blocked on the unguarded `<-resultsChannel`; the message
  is redelivered into the next `Receive` while the old callback leaks.

So `msg.ID` is **not unique across overlapping deliveries**, yet it is the
correlation key. The model encodes exactly this and checks two properties:

- **`AckIntegrity`** *(safety)* — a message is Ack'd only by a callback whose **own**
  dispatched work completed.
- **`NoStuckCallback`** *(liveness)* — every callback that blocks on its channel
  eventually unblocks (no leaked goroutine).

With `AtomicCorrelation = FALSE` (the current design), TLC finds a 5-step trace
violating **both**:

```
deliver #1        regOwner := 1, dispatch #1, callback#1 blocks on its channel
deliver #2 (redelivery, same msg.ID, before #1 finished)
                  regOwner := 2 (OVERWRITES), dispatch #2, callback#2 blocks
worker finishes #1's work
                  loads resultChannels[id] = channel #2  -> signals callback#2
callback#2 wakes  -> msg.Ack()   <-- AckIntegrity violated: acked on #1's result
                                     while #2's own request is still outstanding
                  -> defer Delete(msg.ID) removes the registration
callback#1 never gets signaled    <-- NoStuckCallback violated: leaked forever
```

The consequences in production: a duplicate inference dispatch, a message **Ack'd on
the wrong delivery's result** (so the retry safety net is silently disarmed), a
leaked goroutine per occurrence, and a wrong `message_latency` sample.

**The fix the model validates.** Set `AtomicCorrelation = TRUE` and both properties
hold. That corresponds to: give each *delivery* its own correlation (don't key shared
state on `msg.ID` alone), have the worker signal the delivery that actually produced
the work, and have a callback clear only its own registration (plus guard the receive
with `ctx`). Note the model still shows `dispatchCount` reaching 2 even when fixed —
at-least-once delivery means **duplicate dispatch is inherent**; the fix removes the
*mis-correlation and the leak*, but genuine end-to-end dedup still needs an
idempotency key downstream.

## Running TLC

You need Java and `tla2tools.jar`
([download](https://github.com/tlaplus/tlaplus/releases)):

```bash
cd docs/specs

# 1. translate the PlusCal algorithm into TLA+ (regenerates the TRANSLATION block)
java -cp tla2tools.jar pcal.trans GateQuota.tla

# 2. model-check (uses GateQuota.cfg)
java -cp tla2tools.jar tlc2.TLC GateQuota.tla
#    -> "Model checking completed. No error has been found."

# the race variant — expected to FAIL, printing the over-admission trace
java -cp tla2tools.jar pcal.trans GateQuotaRace.tla
java -cp tla2tools.jar tlc2.TLC GateQuotaRace.tla
#    -> "Invariant NoOverAdmission is violated."

# the message-lifecycle model. -deadlock disables deadlock checking because clean
# termination (message acked, all callbacks done) is the expected end state here.
java -cp tla2tools.jar pcal.trans MsgLifecycle.tla

# current design -> AckIntegrity violated (5-state trace)
java -cp tla2tools.jar tlc2.TLC -deadlock -config MsgLifecycle_buggy.cfg MsgLifecycle.tla
# current design, liveness only -> NoStuckCallback violated (a callback stutters forever)
java -cp tla2tools.jar tlc2.TLC -deadlock -config MsgLifecycle_buggy_live.cfg MsgLifecycle.tla
# corrected design -> "No error has been found."
java -cp tla2tools.jar tlc2.TLC -deadlock -config MsgLifecycle_fixed.cfg MsgLifecycle.tla
```

(The buggy run uses two configs only because TLC stops at the first invariant
violation, so liveness gets its own config with no invariants.)

The `.cfg` files fix the model size (workers/tiers/limits). The `\* BEGIN/END
TRANSLATION` block in each `.tla` is generated by `pcal.trans` from the
`--algorithm` block above it — edit the PlusCal, re-run `pcal.trans`, re-check.

## Scope and caveats

- This models the **algorithm**, not the Go implementation. It gives confidence the
  design is correct; it does not verify the code matches the design. For
  `MsgLifecycle` in particular, the model asserts the *hazard* is real and reachable
  under at-least-once redelivery — confirm against the code paths cited above before
  acting; a fix should come with a regression test, not just a green model.
- It assumes Redis operations are linearizable and the Lua check-and-increment is
  atomic — which is what justifies single-step `acquire` in `GateQuota.tla`.
- Numbers in the `.cfg` are small on purpose: model checking is exhaustive, so a
  few workers and tiers (or, for `MsgLifecycle`, two deliveries of one message)
  already cover every interleaving class. Larger models cost state space without
  changing the conclusions.
